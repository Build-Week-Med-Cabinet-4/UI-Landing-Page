Web Unit 1
This is the Med Cabinet website.

Med Cabinet is for new cannabis consumers (especially those trying to get off of pharmaceuticals) who want to use cannabis as a means to battle medical conditions and ailments. We want to help patients find the right strains, dosing, intake method and intake schedule! Smoking is not the only form of intaking cannabis. If you would prefer not to inhale combusted flower, then an edible, wax, oil, tincture, via vaporizer, and more! 

Dispensaries and strain information can be found on the website. It also host a bit of cannabis news on the bottom.
